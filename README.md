## üß™ Test Scenario

1. User selects "aggressive" profile
2. ML model predicts 18% APY from Curve
3. Platform auto-deploys funds via smart contract
4. Keeper triggers weekly rebalance based on APY update
5. Oracle detects anomaly ‚Üí circuit breaker halts operations
6. User notified and funds withdrawn to fallback vault

## üîê Security Features
