# AI-Driven Yield Farming Optimization Engine

A comprehensive, production-ready DeFi yield farming platform that leverages artificial intelligence to optimize returns while managing risk through automated strategies and real-time monitoring.

## 🎯 Objective

Create a decentralized platform that:
- Predicts optimal farming strategies using AI/ML
- Automates deposits, withdrawals, and rebalancing
- Implements safety features like circuit breakers
- Provides a seamless one-click user interface
- Achieves consistently high APY compared to manual yield farming

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Solidity** - Smart contracts for vaults and farming strategies
- **Python + TensorFlow** - AI/ML models for yield prediction
- **Web3.py** - Blockchain interaction and automation
- **Chainlink Keepers / Gelato** - Automated task execution
- **React** - Frontend user interface
- **Hardhat** - Smart contract development and testing
- **IPFS** - Decentralized storage (optional)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 16.0.0
- Python >= 3.8
- Git

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd AI-driven-Yield-Farming-Optimization-Engine

# Install dependencies
npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Compile smart contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Run tests

```

## 🧠 System Components

### 1. AI Yield Prediction Engine
- Train ML models using historical DeFi data (APYs, liquidity, volatility, gas prices)
- TensorFlow-based models for short-term yield performance prediction
- Risk profile optimization (conservative/moderate/aggressive)
- Python microservices for inference

### 2. Smart Contracts for Yield Management
- Solidity contracts for deposits/withdrawals and strategy switching
- Integration with Compound, Aave, Yearn, Uniswap protocols
- Emergency withdraw, pause, and harvest functions
- ERC-4626 vault tokenization standard

### 3. Keeper Network Automation
- Chainlink Keepers/Gelato for autonomous execution
- Automated rebalancing and reward harvesting
- Strategy switching based on AI predictions
- On-chain trigger mechanisms

### 4. Security and Fail-Safes
- Circuit breakers for APY drops and protocol exploits
- Multi-signature authorization for updates
- Rate limiting and withdrawal locks
- Comprehensive risk assessment

### 5. Frontend & User Experience
- One-click strategy deployment
- Live dashboard with APY predictions and risk scores
- Risk profile selector and portfolio management
- Real-time vault allocation visualization

## 🧪 Test Scenario

1. User selects "aggressive" profile
2. ML model predicts 18% APY from Curve
3. Platform auto-deploys funds via smart contract
4. Keeper triggers weekly rebalance based on APY update
5. Oracle detects anomaly → circuit breaker halts operations
6. User notified and funds withdrawn to fallback vault

## 🔐 Security Features

- Multi-signature wallet integration
- Time-locked upgrades
- Emergency pause functionality
- Slippage protection
- MEV protection mechanisms

## 📊 Performance Metrics

- Target APY: 15-25% (depending on risk profile)
- Rebalancing frequency: Daily to weekly
- Gas optimization: L2 integration (Arbitrum, Optimism)
- Uptime: 99.9% availability target
